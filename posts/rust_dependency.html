<h2>Thoughts on Rust's Dependency &quot;Problem&quot;</h2>
<p>Rust projects are sometimes criticized for their tendency to encourage dependency
bloat. I'd like to outline a couple of reasons why I think this happens, and offer a step
towards addressing the issue.</p>
<p>Dependency bloat happens when a project takes on more external dependencies (like
supporting libraries/crates) than are deemed necessary. There's no generally accepted rule
on where to draw the line between a dependency being warranted or not, so our judgment
is more or less limited to our own bias and experience. Let's assume that projects can be
bloated and consider why that is a bad thing.</p>
<h3>Bloat is Transitive</h3>
<p>If you're writing software for your own private consumption, never to be used by anyone
else, and the software runs on your own machines (or machines that you rent with your own
money), then I have good news for you: nobody else's opinion matters! You can pull in as
many dependencies as you think are appropriate, so go ahead and use that
<a href="https://docs.rs/is-even/latest/is_even/trait.IsEven.html"><code>is_even</code></a> crate. What's the
worst that can happen? 😅</p>
<p>On the other hand, if your project is in the public sphere and is useful to others, bloat
matters. If someone imports your crate, they just inherited all the dependencies <em>your</em>
project uses, in addition to whatever other dependencies they have. That may be a drop in
the bucket, or it may be the entire bucket! The point is that bloat is exponentially
transitive. Every project that depends on a bloated one becomes itself at least a little
more bloated, on and on down the line for every project in the dependency chain.</p>
<p>For people who care about system resource usage, or even cognitive complexity, managing
dependencies efficiently is important. Before considering a solution (or least part of
one), let's consider two reasons why projects may bloat.</p>
<h3>Rust's Small Standard Library</h3>
<p>Rust is somewhat unique among modern programming languages in that is has a very small
standard library. When compared to a language like Go, the difference is apparent. Examples
of functionality that Go's standard library has but Rust's does not include:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTTP support (client, server)</li>
<li>serialization/encoding for formats like JSON and XML</li>
<li>cryptography, including TLS, SHA256, AES, etc.</li>
<li>compression</li>
<li>images (PNG/JPEG)</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rust has a good <a href="https://crates.io">ecosystem of libraries</a> to support all these cases, and
some libraries are even popular enough to be considered &quot;standard&quot; (like
<code>serde</code> for serialization or
<code>tokio</code> for async), but sometimes you just want to use
the single, supported thing and instead have to decide between various crates. It's just
not as straightforward as importing whatever the language gives you.</p>
<h3>A Good Package Manager</h3>
<p>cargo is Rust's integrated build tool, package manager, and test runner. It basically
&quot;just works&quot; and, in my opinion, is one of Rust's killer features (which is admittedly
kind of sad to say in 2025, but that's the state of modern programming).</p>
<p>cargo makes it very easy to add libraries to your project, either by manually editing
<code>Cargo.toml</code> or running <code>cargo add some_package</code> from the command line. Unlike Python's
pip, cargo resolves dependencies per-project, which avoids collisions (there's
also system-wide caching for projects that share the same dependencies).
<a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a> is the community package registry, which contains quality
crates, so there's really not much friction when going to add something to your project.
You just search for what you're looking for, <code>cargo add</code> it to your project, and boom,
you're off.</p>
<p>Rust packaging requires no collision management, no manually pasting header and source
files, no messing with make/cmake, or choosing between maven, gradle, or ant. It's pretty
much a no-fuss experience. If a project isn't diligent in tracking dependencies (or just
doesn't care), things <em>can</em> grow to the point of being bloated.</p>
<p>So what can we do?</p>
<h3>Crate Tagging by Dependency Types</h3>
<p>I'd like to propose providing projects a way to signal what kinds of dependencies
they use. Suppose we create a layering system like the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Layer 0: the standard library and <code>libc</code> (which the standard library links to), which
depend on nothing,</li>
<li>Layer 1: any published crate that <em>only</em> depends on the standard library or <code>libc</code>,</li>
<li>Layer 2: any published crate that depends on at least one Layer 1 crate (but no higher),</li>
<li>Layer 3: any published crate that depends on at least one Layer 2 crate (but no higher),</li>
<li>Layer 4: everything else.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under this scheme, a crate could be automatically assessed and tagged with a layer by the
registry when being published. cargo's <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html#version-requirement-syntax">version requirements</a>
could be updated to include optional layer specifiers for enforcement (e.g. <code>other_crate = { version = &quot;1.2.3&quot;, layer = 2 }</code>). It'd also be nice to indicate some kind of layer
restrictions at different scopes of a project as part of the build process, like in the
context of team projects where someone wants to say &quot;this crate shouldn't build if we've
accidentally imported a layer 4 crate&quot;.</p>
<p>The purpose here is to provide tools for projects to reason about the kinds of
dependencies they use. One advantage of the &quot;signaling&quot; approach is that, apart from the
automatic tagging by the registry, enforcement is fully in your control. If you don't
care, you just don't specify any layer requirements.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Let me close by acknowledging that I don't necessarily think dependency bloat is something
to be &quot;solved&quot; in the generic sense, as in there being some universal metric to measure
and eliminate it. Dependency management, like many aspects of software, is a game of
wrangling constraints and trade-offs specific to <em>your</em> project. The approach outlined
above attempts to make a project's dependency management intentions more explicit but not
objective.</p>
<p>So that's the gist of it. Contact me on GitHub to share thoughts and criticisms. Thanks!</p>
