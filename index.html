2024-05-20 13:31:58.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Range values no longer stored for load.
2024-05-20 13:08:32.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Fixed a couple tests incorrectly relying on io markers in def.
2024-05-20 13:02:06.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Only non-def function calls need to be io wrapped.
2024-05-18 21:32:52.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Enforce wrapping all io operations.

2024-05-10 13:00:34.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Changed builtins to 'native'
2024-05-09 12:43:05.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Eval now returns values instead of using the stack.

Still untangling call. I'll continue to make passes over it until things are unified.
2024-05-08 21:51:27.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Updated TODO.
2024-05-08 21:49:44.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Fixed dyn issue.

The new plan is to not use a dynamic trait. Instead, for better or worse, function
variants are going to be put under a 'generic' FuncKind enum, consisting of two variants:
* Native
* User

Native functions will wholly take the place of keyword implementations and builtins, while User
functions will be largely as they are now. This implies that every native function will be a variant
under FuncKind::Native. I think that's fine for a small core of natives, but I'd have to redesign this
(likely entirely) if it were to expand.

This also paves the way for io functions.
2024-05-07 19:30:04.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Starting function interface refactor...
2024-05-01 2:18:26.0 +00:00:00     cottage                  Added missing display stuff on Type for map.
2024-05-01 2:02:13.0 +00:00:00     cottage                  Maps can be indexed.
2024-04-30 13:30:30.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Added map literals and required commans on vec literals.
2024-04-29 21:31:21.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Update TODOs
2024-04-29 13:15:04.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Finally got indexed/dotted access working.

Expressions will likely need to be pulled apart more concretely.
Call is still a bit of a mess. Builtin and keyword ops need to be
unified under the  interface.
2024-04-26 22:38:16.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Fixed tokenize and parse for dots and indexes.

I think I'll have to do this again to generalize all expressions, but this makes some progress...
2024-04-26 0:40:10.0 +00:00:00     cottage                  Removed dotted load.
2024-04-25 23:54:42.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  My lack of actual expression parsing is now apparent.

I can't evaluate something like v[t.a], where t is (T (a: number), without it.
Numeric indexes like v[10] or v[ten] work as expected, but I have to make expr
2024-04-23 22:01:38.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Added vec type, op, values, tokenization and new allocation.
2024-04-23 14:11:01.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Merged syntax highlight/lang provision and LSP into single extension.
