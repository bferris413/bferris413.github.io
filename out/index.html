2024-06-10 23:15:22.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Added simple threadpool.

2024-06-04 13:49:50.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Added if.
2024-06-03 16:01:37.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Updated todo.
2024-06-03 16:00:29.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Added loop and break, but I forgot I needed if to test conditions...
2024-05-31 14:14:35.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Added !=
2024-05-31 13:37:01.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Added =
2024-05-30 12:47:16.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Updated TODO.

2024-05-30 12:35:32.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Added logical and
2024-05-29 0:10:36.0 +00:00:00     cottage                  Removed 1 from index len due to copy/paste =)
2024-05-29 0:02:35.0 +00:00:00     cottage                  Added >= and <=
2024-05-28 14:46:26.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Added >.
2024-05-28 13:42:33.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Added < operator.

2024-05-24 13:21:36.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Updated TODO.
2024-05-24 13:10:50.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Added data accesses to set.

2024-05-23 16:21:25.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Added set for 'places' in maps. Vec and data are likely implemented, need tests.
2024-05-23 13:27:01.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Removed a bunch of misused macro calls.

2024-05-20 13:34:14.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Updated TODO, starting variable assignment.
2024-05-20 13:31:58.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Range values no longer stored for load.
2024-05-20 13:08:32.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Fixed a couple tests incorrectly relying on io markers in def.
2024-05-20 13:02:06.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Only non-def function calls need to be io wrapped.
2024-05-18 21:32:52.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Enforce wrapping all io operations.
2024-05-14 16:03:43.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Added io tracing.
2024-05-11 0:21:07.0 +00:00:00     cottage                  Updated TODO, moving to IO lang support to enforce/save myself.
2024-05-11 0:19:26.0 +00:00:00     cottage                  Added text write to file.
2024-05-10 15:22:07.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Added file open and delineation between keyable values, or not.
2024-05-10 13:00:34.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Changed builtins to 'native'
2024-05-09 12:43:05.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Eval now returns values instead of using the stack.

Still untangling call. I'll continue to make passes over it until things are unified.
2024-05-08 21:51:27.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Updated TODO.
2024-05-08 21:49:44.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Fixed dyn issue.

The new plan is to not use a dynamic trait. Instead, for better or worse, function
variants are going to be put under a 'generic' FuncKind enum, consisting of two variants:
* Native
* User

Native functions will wholly take the place of keyword implementations and builtins, while User
functions will be largely as they are now. This implies that every native function will be a variant
under FuncKind::Native. I think that's fine for a small core of natives, but I'd have to redesign this
(likely entirely) if it were to expand.

This also paves the way for io functions.
2024-05-07 19:30:04.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Starting function interface refactor...
2024-05-01 2:18:26.0 +00:00:00     cottage                  Added missing display stuff on Type for map.
2024-05-01 2:02:13.0 +00:00:00     cottage                  Maps can be indexed.
2024-04-30 13:30:30.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Added map literals and required commans on vec literals.
2024-04-29 21:31:21.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Update TODOs
2024-04-29 13:15:04.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Finally got indexed/dotted access working.

Expressions will likely need to be pulled apart more concretely.
Call is still a bit of a mess. Builtin and keyword ops need to be
unified under the  interface.
2024-04-26 22:38:16.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Fixed tokenize and parse for dots and indexes.

I think I'll have to do this again to generalize all expressions, but this makes some progress...
2024-04-26 0:40:10.0 +00:00:00     cottage                  Removed dotted load.
2024-04-25 23:54:42.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  My lack of actual expression parsing is now apparent.

I can't evaluate something like v[t.a], where t is (T (a: number), without it.
Numeric indexes like v[10] or v[ten] work as expected, but I have to make expr
2024-04-23 22:01:38.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Added vec type, op, values, tokenization and new allocation.
2024-04-23 14:11:01.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Merged syntax highlight/lang provision and LSP into single extension.
2024-04-23 13:33:30.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Updated README with Getting Started section.
2024-04-23 12:31:05.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Updated package.json and README for LSP.
2024-04-22 23:09:38.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Fixed an issue where decorations were applied to non-cottage docs.
2024-04-22 21:59:30.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Added cached decorations, multi-document decoration support, multi-decoration support.
2024-04-22 17:10:23.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Added alignment and basic styling to value results.
2024-04-22 14:03:20.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Two things:
* Moved backend stuff to its own subdirectory for a cleaner project heirarchy.
Iterated on semantic decorations. It's not finished, or really even close, but I realized I had the changes associated with that combined with the restructuring.
2024-04-21 1:03:08.0 +00:00:00     cottage                  Added basic TextDecoration plumbing. =)
2024-04-18 12:24:57.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Started text decorator.
I finally found how popular extensions like Quokka and GitLens modify the CSS in the editor.
My first two guesses were inline values and inlay hints, but inline values seems to be available
during debugging only, and inlay hints didn't offer much style customizations. I was beginning
to think I'd have to implement a CustomTextEditor until I discovered the TextDecorator API.
2024-04-15 14:09:35.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Always-on range value support for all expressions.
2024-04-14 22:12:00.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Function calls and template def stored in range values, still missing keyword, builtin, and initializers.
2024-04-14 20:09:12.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Added load and dotted load range values.

* Moved push range/stack logic to helper.
2024-04-12 21:58:54.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Added range support for primitive values.
2024-04-12 14:10:36.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Moved context to its own module.
2024-04-11 23:30:08.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Starting range mapping, updated TODO.
2024-04-11 13:11:09.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Fixed accidental unwrap.

The fail! macros are showing their age, they should be returning an expr, not result.
2024-04-11 12:22:08.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Moved execute/parse/tokenize into their own modules.
2024-04-10 14:21:48.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Ops include their text ranges.
2024-04-10 12:21:57.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Added inline-value plumbing but it seems like it's only sent by the client during debug sessions.
2024-04-09 0:51:33.0 +00:00:00     cottage                  Added dotted load eval and, more importantly, function calls from loaded values.

The implementation is bad all around. The whole error handling scheme, using ops and names, is poor.
The idea of loading some values and explicitly handling others, all under the guise of OpKind::Load, is
confusing.
2024-04-08 16:15:59.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Intermediate commit, OpCall needs to accept Op instead of name, args.
2024-04-07 19:14:30.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Can parse dotted fields, like var.field1.field2
2024-04-05 22:55:29.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Added io blocks.
2024-04-02 1:17:23.0 +00:00:00     cottage                  Template initialization.
2024-03-30 21:48:18.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Finish user types in params, start (Type <arg>*)
2024-03-30 21:12:34.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Added user-defined types to type checks.
2024-03-28 13:12:01.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Added initial readme.
2024-03-28 13:01:44.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Refactored execute loop for basic readability.
2024-03-27 13:41:50.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Added TODO, wasn't versioned.
2024-03-27 13:22:49.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Added a couple err-case tests for template definition
2024-03-27 0:03:29.0 +00:00:00     cottage                  Added template definitions.
2024-03-26 1:11:56.0 +00:00:00     cottage                  Added support for 'special forms', in this case essentially syntax like function calls without evaluating args.

Moved 'def' to this type of form
Was done in preparation for 'template' definitions
2024-03-20 15:35:49.0 +00:00:00    cottage                  Added line comments.

2024-01-03 15:10:57.0 +00:00:00    budget                   Fixed issue where the account totaller wasn't representing the full total.

This happened because the totaller assumed categories were unique. With the introduction of years,
a single category name may be present multiple times (e.g. 2023 -> Maint., 2024 -> Maint.).

The structure used to keep totals was a map of [category] -> total, so only the last written category
for whatever year was being captured.

The straightforward solution was to change the structure to [year] -> { [category] -> total }.

The REPL is broken but that's not a huge deal...

2022-06-15 22:27:46.0 +00:00:00    moonshot                 Resolution working, but there are a few issues:
* functions defined in a block aren't saved in the blocks scope. This probably has to do with them being saved in the global scope.
* anonymous functions panic because there's no resolver support.

2022-05-15 22:57:03.0 +00:00:00    moonshot                 Fixed parse rule for anon functions.

Parsing a statement like  would error because  was assumed to
be a named function declaration. With the addition of anonymous functions,
 is a valid expression, even if it's result (a function object)
isn't captured.

This commit fixes that.
